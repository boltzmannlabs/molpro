Here we are using an AI approach to generate novel molecules starting from a seed compound, its three-dimensional (3D) shape. A variational autoencoder is used to generate the 3D representation of a compound, followed by a system of convolutional for encoding and recurrent neural networks that generate a sequence of SMILES tokens. The generative design of novel scaffolds and functional groups can cover unexplored regions of chemical space that still possess lead-like properties.
